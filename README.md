# Animated Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains work and exercises from the course "JavaScript Data Structures & Algorithms + LEETCODE Exercises" by Scott Barrett on Udemy. The course covers various data structures and algorithms, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and sorting algorithms. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of these concepts through practical examples and exercises.
The course also includes a section on LeetCode exercises, which are commonly used in technical interviews. The exercises are designed to help students practice and improve their problem-solving skills using data structures and algorithms.
